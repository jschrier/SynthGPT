# Results for precursor selection

- Each directory contains the results of the methods described
- Each prediction method generates a JSON file 
- GPT predictions were rescored by removing O2 and H2O precursors, as discussed in the Supporting Information
- `combined` directory contains results from combining top-5 predictions from the Elemwise and GPT-3.5 (FT) models and using a GPT-4-turbo model to evaluate the predictions and select 5; we discuss the results at length in the Supporting Information.
